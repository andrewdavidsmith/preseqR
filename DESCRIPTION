Description: The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample is a classic problem back to Fisher (1943) <doi:10.2307/1411>. We generalize this problem to predict the number of species represented at least r times in a random sample. In particular when r=1, it becomes the classic problem. We use a mixture of Poisson processes to model sampling procedures and apply an empirical Bayes approach to obtain a rational function estimator. The approach can be applied to assess the quality of DNA sequencing libraries and optimize depths of sequencing experiments.
