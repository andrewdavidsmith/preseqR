Description: Originally an R version of Preseq
  <doi:10.1038/nmeth.2375>, this package now has extended
  functionality to predict the r-species accumulation curve (r-SAC),
  which is the number of species represented at least r times as a
  function of the sampling effort. When r = 1, the curve is known as
  the species accumulation curve, or the library complexity curve in
  high-throughput genomic sequencing. The package includes both
  parametric and nonparametric methods, as described by Deng et
  al. (2018) <arXiv:1607.02804v3>.
